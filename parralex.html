                    Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only 
                    celestial body known to harbor life. It has a 
                    diameter of about 12,742 kilometers, orbits the Sun 
                    at an average distance of 150 million kilometers 
                    (1 AU), and completes one orbit every 365.25 days.
                     Earth’s unique combination of a protective 
                     atmosphere, abundant liquid water, and a magnetic 
                     field makes it a rare oasis in the solar system.

                     About 71% of Earth’s surface is covered by oceans,
                      while the remaining land hosts vast continents, 
                      mountains, deserts, and forests. Its atmosphere 
                      is composed mainly of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen,
                       which supports respiration and shields the planet
                        from harmful solar radiation. Earth’s axial tilt
                         of 23.5° gives rise to changing seasons, while 
                         its single natural satellite, the Moon, 
                         influences tides and helps stabilize Earth’s
                          rotation.
